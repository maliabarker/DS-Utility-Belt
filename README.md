## Included: <br>

**DS Prototypic Engines** <br>

1. Analysis Engine - Some basics to start analysis including null value imputation and processing, basic statistical information, structure for some comparative analytical questions, and creating and saving data dictionaries (with numerical encoding needed for visualization)

*NOTE: This analysis engine works directly with the following visualization engine, and will need to be instantiated to use with the visualization engine.* <br>

<br>

2. Visualization Engine - Some basic visualizations, including scatter plots and bar graphs to match certain analysis questions from the analysis engine. Also includes a normal distribution function.<br>
<br>

3. Web Scraping Engine - Put in a URL and some basic items you want to search for (make sure this is a URL with minimal javascript functions, to be updated soon). Returns a text file for all your scraping needs. <br>
<br>

**Helper Functions** <br>

1. Import all your data analysis and visualization needs. Includes numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and more! <br>
